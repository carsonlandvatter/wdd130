        <p>My name is Carson Landvatter. I aspire to one day be a software engineer. I enjoy snowboarding and live in Salt Lake City, UT. I am so excited to be a part of BYU Pathway Connect and can't wait to learn more about Web Development. This has been my favorite course so far because I love designing and creating websites for personal and professional use. Can't wait to see where I will be on my web development journey in a couple years.</p>
